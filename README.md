# a-game-bot-practice **EOL**
* This is a practice project of game bot I created in 2018 and it's **INVALID** now.   
* I used it in COOP mode which player against very retarded bot. I think it's not harmful to the game because if there is a bot in my team always means human teammates will gain more damage make and kills, and with rare affect to the battle result( the bot have 98%+ winrate while a human players usually at 99%-100%). The total bonus of a game play is limited, which means it provided higher bonus and exp to my teammates. However it was banned permanently in last year :P   
* Even though it's primary and na√ève, I usually define this projects as a transition of my programming from simple script to practice, last for four years( 2018 - 2022) which is also my most perplex days in my life journey till now. It's time to say goodbye.
